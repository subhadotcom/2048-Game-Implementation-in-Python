Developed a fully functional 2048 game using Python, implementing grid-based gameplay mechanics and an intuitive user interface.

 - Utilized the NumPy library for efficient grid operations and pygame for graphical interface and user interactions. 

 - Designed algorithms for dynamic tile merging, random number generation, and win/lose state detection. 

 - Added advanced features like an "Undo" option, move validation, and adaptive grid scaling for different board sizes. 

 - Enhanced game performance by optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging modular, object-oriented programming. 

 - Gained experience in Python game development, library integration, and user-focused design.
